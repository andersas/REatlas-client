\section{Brief introduction to the REatlas and some terminology}

The REatlas is a computer program designed to convert
weather data into production profiles for wind and photovoltaics (solar) power
technologies. It has a server part and a client part. The server part
runs on a big computer, located at Aarhus University, and does the actual computation, while the client
part can be run on any personal computer.

The REatlas server is what is known as a \emph{Remote Procedure Call} (RPC)
server, i.e. it is a server that allows you to execute function calls
on it, as if they were executed on the client computer.

The REatlas client is simply a library for setting up and handling
the connection and underlying protocol for the RPC server.

\subsection{Cutouts}

The weather data is global and consists of large arrays of meterological
parameters from the CFSR\cite{cfsr}, such as wind speed and sun light intensity.
Each entry, or \emph{grid cell} in such an array is identified by the latitude and longitude of its center, and it represents a
geographical localtion somewhere in the world.

Because of the size of the data set, you
typically will not want to work with all of it at the same time,
since it will take several days to convert it all to production timeseries.

Therefore, you cut out some part of the world that you are interested in.
This could for example be Europe, USA, China or Denmark.
The smaller the area, the faster the conversion.

A \emph{cutout} is such a selection of an area of interest. 
Cutouts can either be box shaped (with sides of constant latitude/longitude) or a collection of individual grid cells.

\subsection{Aggregation and capacity layouts}

The main purpose of the atlas is to generate time series
for regions of interest, e.g. countries or continents.

When all the grid cells in a cutout are converted,
a new grid (i.e. array) of production values are created
with the same dimensions as the raw data arrays.

To get a time series (under the \emph{copper plate assumption})
of the region of interest, a \emph{capacity layout} is needed.
This is simply an array with the same shape as the
cutout, where each grid cell is assigned a \emph{weight}.
This weight could e.g. be the installed capacity in MW or the number
of turbines/solar panels per cell.

An \emph{aggregation} is the process of multiplying all grid cells
with the corresponding weight in a capacity layout and summing up
the resulting values.

If the capacity layout e.g. contains 1's everywhere in the region,
and 0's eleswhere, a time series for the region will be obtained
with capacity uniformly distributed across it.

\section{Installing the client}

The client can be downloaded from github.com/AUESG.
It requires Python and Numpy to run, and optionally scipy (for Matlab support)
and pyshp (for GIS support). Python can be downloaded from python.org,
and Numpy can be downloaded from numpy.org.

To use the REatlas, you must have an account on the server.

To connect to the server, you must be on the Aarhus University
internal network. If you're running the client from outside
the intranet, you have 3 options:

\begin{itemize}
     \item Tunnel through pepsi (you need an account on pepsi for this):

          \verb+ssh -L 65535:pepsimax.imf.au.dk:65535 pepsi.imf.au.dk+
     \item Tunnel through NFIT's LogInFArm (you need an NFIT account for this):

          \verb+ssh -L 65535:pepsimax.imf.au.dk:65535 lifa.phys.au.dk+
     \item Use the AU VPN solution (you need an AU VPN account for this).

\end{itemize}
Note that if you use the ssh options to tunnel through AU firewalls,
you should connect the REatlas client to "localhost" instead of using
the server name.


\section{Client commands}

The client consists of a client library, and a collection of command line
utilities based on the library. These command line utilities can be
used without any programming effort.

\subsection{Note about working with capacity layouts and shapefiles}

A capacity layout is an array in the same shape as the layout for
which it is meant to be applied.

The command line utility \verb+cmd_get_cutout_metadata.py+ downloads
arrays in this shape, containing latitude, longitude, on/offshore and
depth/height data. You can repurpose these arrays for making
capacity layouts.

When you download the metadata as a shapefile, you can edit
this shapefile (e.g. with ArcGis or quantum gis, qgis).
The shapefile contains points representing the center of each grid cell.
The attribute table contains the field ``CAPACITY''.
By changing this field, you can assign a capacity to each grid cell
and use the shapefile as input capacity layout. See figure \ref{fig:qgis}.

\section{Usage examples and exercises (client library)}

In this section, a few excercises in using the REatlas client library are given.
A script that solves the problems can be found in the exercises.py file.

Before trying the exercises, you should have some sort of network connection
to the REatlas, along with an account.

Using interactive python (IPython) is recommended, or alternatively
writing a Python script.

Note that the RPC functions require their full keyword arguments
specified. I.e. positional arguments does not work.
The reason for this has something to do with the underlying RPC protocol 
for sending function arguments.


\subsection{Exercise 1: Familiarize youself with the atlas}

In this exercise, you will connect to the REatlas and take a look around.

\begin{enumerate}
     \item Download the REatlas client software from github.com/AUESG.
     \item Login to the REatlas (use the connect\_and\_login function).
     \item Succesfully call the echo() and generate\_error() functions.
           generate\_error() will give you an example error message.
     \item Get a list of all the cutouts that are available on the server.
           How much space does Europe and Denmark take up?
           (answer: 133 GB and 3 GB, respectively)
     \item Download all the metadata for Europe and/or Denmark.
           (Hint: use the prepare\_cutout\_metadata() and download\_file() functions).
           How many points are there in the Europe/Denmark cutout?
           (Hint: derive this from the shape of the latitude/longitude array.
           Answer: 21279 and 600, respectively)
      \item Start a dummy job (a job that does nothing for 15 seconds) on
           the server, and read the email you get when it finishes.
           Start another dummy job without receiving an email when it finishes.
           (hint: use the notify\_by\_mail() function).

      \item Use the wait\_for\_job() function to wait for a dummy job to finish.
           How could the wait\_for\_job() function be useful (in a script)?

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 2: Wind conversion}

In this exercise, you will perform a wind conversion on the REatlas server,
and you will create example capacity layouts.
     
\begin{enumerate}
     \item Find out how much power a Vestas V90 3MW turbine would have produced
           on January 13, 1992 at 05.00 UTC if it were placed
           on 56.9 degrees latitude, 7.5 degrees longitude.
           (answer: 2.9 MW). According to the REatlas (and to Google maps),
           is this point onshore or offshore?
           According to the REatlas, how deep is the water in this grid cell?
           (answer: 29 meters)

           Hints:
           \begin{enumerate}
               \item Load the Vestas V90 3MW config file with the
                    REatlas client provided turbineconf\_to\_powercurve\_object() function.
               \item Make a capacity layout for Denmark/Europe
                     consisting of only 0's except for the grid cell
                     containing 56.9 degrees latitude, 7.5 degrees longitude.
                     This grid cell should contain a 1.
                     Applying this capacity layout effectively gives
                     the timeseries for that single grid cell.

                \item You can find the index of that grid cell by using the
                     translate\_GPS\_coordinates\_to\_array\_indices() function
                     provided by the REatlas client on the metadata for the cutout.
                     For Denmark, 56.9,7.5 degrees has the index (9,12).
                \item Upload the capacity layout with upload\_file()
                \item Select the cutout you want to work with with the 
                     select\_cutout() function.
                \item Start a wind conversion with convert\_and\_aggregate\_wind().
                \item Download the resulting file, and use the ``dates'' metadata file to find the timeseries index for 1992 at 05:00 utc.
                     numpy.where and datetime.datetime will be useful for this purpose.
           \end{enumerate}
      \item Get a normalized time series of wind production for Denmark in the 
           period 1979-2010 for a Vestas V90 3 MW turbine if it were
           distributed uniformly in all onshore grid cells.
      \item Get two normalized timeseries using only one call to the
           convert\_and\_aggregate\_wind() function. Use the capacity layouts
           from the previous two exercises.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exercise 3: PV conversion}

In this exercise, you will perform a PV conversion on the REatlas server,
and you will create example capacity layouts.
You will compare a solar cell mounted in a fixed position to 
a distribution of orientations, and to a solar panel that tracks the sun.


\begin{enumerate}
     \item As an approximation, assume that a side of a house can either face
          east, west or south (and that nobody installs solar panels on a north facing side), and that all roofs have a slope of 45 degrees.
          Perform a PV conversion with the Scheuten 215IG roof-mounted panel
          distributed equally in all Danish onshore grid cells
          with a distribution of 33 \% of panels facing west, 33\% facing east
          and 34\% facing south (azimuth: 90, -90 and 0 degrees, respectively).
          
          Hint: This follows the same procedure as for wind conversion,
          except panel config files are loaded with the
          solarpanelconf\_to\_solar\_panel\_config\_object() function,
          and that solar panel orientations must also be specified before
          calling convert\_and\_aggregate\_pv().

          You can add orientations to PV conversion with the add\_*\_orientation\_function() functions.
          Each call to convert\_and\_aggregate\_pv resets the choice of orientations. This is also true for reset\_orientations().
          You can use the latter for undoing mistakes.

     \item Perform another PV conversion and aggregation for onshore Denmark
           where all panels point straight south and have a slope of 32 degrees.
           Perform another PV conversion and aggregation for onshore Denmark
           where each panel tracks the sun.
      \item Plot (with e.g. matplotlib.pyplot) sample days for the three
           different conversions and compare them.
\end{enumerate}


\section{Available functions}

\subsection{Overview of client built-in helper functions}

Apart from providing the \verb+REatlas+ object, the REatlas client
also provides these functions:

\subsubsection{turbineconf\_to\_powercurve\_object()}

Used for loading turbine configuration files in as objects. These objects
can be used as arguments in wind conversion calls.

\subsubsection{solarpanelconf\_to\_solar\_panel\_config\_object()}

Used for loading solar panel configuration files in as objects.
These objects can be used as arguments in PV conversion calls.

\subsubsection{translate\_GPS\_coordinates\_to\_array\_indices()}

Can be used to find the grid cell nearest some point given by GPS coordinates.

\subsubsection{Misc.}

Apart from this, the client also provides a few helper functions in the
REatlas object itself. These are:

\begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{download\_file()} Used to download files from the server.
     \item \textbf{upload\_file()} Used to upload files to the server.
     \item \textbf{connect\_and\_login()} Used in interactive mode to connect and login in one go. If you just \verb+connect()+, the connection times out faster than you can type in your login details. This also calls \verb+build_functions()+.
     \item \textbf{build\_functions()} Initially, the client does now know about the RPC functions available. This method queries the server for available RPC functions and adds them as local class methods.
     \item \textbf{add\_pv\_orientations\_by\_config\_file()} Parses a configuration file of orientations and adds them via the add\_*\_orientation\_function() RPC functions. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Overview of RPC methods}

The following functions are defined on the REatlas server,
and can be called as is they were on the client computer.

To call them, you must first call the \verb+REatlas.build_functions()+ or
\verb+REatlas.connect_and_login()+ methods. 

\begin{changemargin}{-1.5cm}{1.5cm}
\input{unprivileged_methods.tex}
\end{changemargin}

\subsection{Overview of privileged RPC methods}

The following functions are also available,
but requres privileged access to execute.

\begin{changemargin}{-1.5cm}{1.5cm}
\input{privileged_methods.tex}
