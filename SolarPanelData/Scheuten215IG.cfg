# The manufacturer of this panel
manufacturer= Scheuten
# Link to the original datasheet of the panel
source= http://www.scheutensolar.de/getfile/33/59/datasheet-p6-54l-integra-goldline-en.pdf
# Solar radiation below which the panel stops giving useful power
threshold=1

# Area of the solar panel in m^2
area=1.503
# Rated production in watt peak (for full area panel)
rated_production=156

# A, B, C are coefficients for the equation : P= A + B*I + C*logI and
# are calculated by using the three different values of solar
# radiation and their peak powers at 25deg C module temperature for
# corresponding radiations from the data sheet
# That model comes from "A robust model for the MPP performance
# of different types of PV-modules applied for the performance
# check of grid connected systems", 2004, by Hans Beyer, Gerd Heilscher
# and Stefan Bofinger
